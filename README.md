Task Management: Add tasks with different priorities (Low, Medium, High).
Weather Integration: Displays weather information when certain task keywords are entered (e.g., "run", "hike").
Task Deletion: Delete tasks from the list.
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, ensuring it works on all screen sizes.
